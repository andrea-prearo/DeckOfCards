# *Deck of Cards* sample

The project implements two main classes:  
- `Card`, to model each individual card  
- `Deck`, to model the deck as a `Card` container  

All code has been developed and tested using `Scala 2.10.3`.  

Unit tests have been implemented using the [Specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) framework.  
Execute `sbt test` to run the test suite.  

An usage example has been provided and can be run with `sbt run`.
