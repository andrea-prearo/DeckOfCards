# *Deck of Cards* sample

The project implements three main classes:  
- `Card`, to model each individual card  
- `Deck`, to model the deck as a `Card` container  
- `Game`, to model the game logic  

All code has been developed and tested using `GHC 8.0.1`.  

Unit tests have been implemented using the [Hspec](http://hspec.github.io/) framework.  
Execute `cabal test` to run the test suite.  

An usage example has been provided and can be run with `cabal run`.
