# *Deck of Cards* sample

The project implements two main classes:  
- ```Card```, to model each individual card  
- ```Deck```, to model the deck as a ```Card``` container  

Each class comes with its own unit tests, implemented using the integrated XCTest framework:  
- ```CardTests```, for ```Card```  
- ```Deck```, for ```Deck```  

The deck shuffle method has been implemented using the [Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle modern_algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_modern_algorithm).  

All the code has been developed and tested using `XCode 7`.
