# *Deck of Cards* sample

The project implements two main classes:  
- ```Card```, to model each individual card  
- ```Deck```, to model the deck as a Card container  

The code has been developed and tested using `Python 2.7.6`.  

Unit tests are provided, for each class, and bundled inside a test suite.
Execute ```python test_suite.py``` to run the test suite, or:  
- ```python card_tests.py```  
- ```python deck_tests.py```  
to run each class unit tests separately.  

An usage example has been provided and can be run with ```python play_with_deck.py```.
