# *Deck of Cards* sample

The project implements two main classes:  
- `Card`, to model each individual card  
- `Deck`, to model the deck as a `Card` container  

All code has been developed and tested using `Python 2.7.6`.  

Unit tests have been implemented and bundled inside a test suite.
Execute `rake test` to run the test suite.  

An usage example has been provided and can be run with `python play_with_deck.py`.
